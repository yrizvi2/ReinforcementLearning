Some of these may overlap with what you've done for VI and PI, but others are more specific to the nature of model-free learning in Q-learning. Here are additional aspects you can consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualizations:\n",
    "1. **Q-Value Convergence Over Time**: Plot the maximum change in Q-values from one iteration to the next to visualize convergence.\n",
    "2. **Action-Value Heatmaps**: Create heatmaps for the Q-values of each action at each state.\n",
    "3. **Epsilon Decay**: Visualize how the exploration rate (epsilon) decays over time if you're using an epsilon decay strategy.\n",
    "4. **Alpha Decay**: If you implement a learning rate decay, visualize how alpha changes over episodes.\n",
    "5. **Reward Distribution**: Visualize the distribution of obtained rewards to see if the agent is consistently improving.\n",
    "6. **Policy Exploration**: Plot which states are most explored, which can be done by tracking state visitation frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metrics and Evaluations:\n",
    "1. **Episode Length Over Time**: Track and plot the length of each episode over time to see if the agent is learning to solve the environment more efficiently.\n",
    "2. **Cumulative Reward**: Track the cumulative reward over time to see the long-term trend.\n",
    "3. **Learning Stability**: Evaluate the variance in rewards and episode lengths to understand the stability of learning.\n",
    "4. **Optimal Path Visualization**: If the state space is not too large, visualize the optimal path(s) found by the agent.\n",
    "5. **Policy Robustness**: Test the learned policy in a variety of initial states to evaluate its robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Parameters:\n",
    "1. **Parameter Sweep**: Conduct a parameter sweep for key parameters like alpha, gamma, and epsilon to find the optimal combination.\n",
    "2. **Impact of Initial Q-values**: Evaluate how different initializations of the Q-table affect learning.\n",
    "3. **Comparison of Exploration Strategies**: Besides epsilon-greedy, try other strategies like UCB (Upper Confidence Bound) or Thompson Sampling and compare results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Metrics:\n",
    "1. **Success/Failure Ratios**: Calculate how often the agent succeeds or fails in the environment.\n",
    "2. **Temporal Differences**: Track the Temporal Difference (TD) error over time.\n",
    "3. **Action Frequency**: Analyze the frequency of each action being taken to understand the agent's strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluations:\n",
    "1. **Policy Consistency**: Check if the policy remains consistent as learning progresses or if it continues to fluctuate.\n",
    "2. **Transfer Learning**: Evaluate how well the Q-learning policy adapts when transferred to a slightly different environment.\n",
    "3. **Sensitivity to Hyperparameters**: Assess how sensitive the learning process is to changes in hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "These additional analyses will help you to not only assess the performance of Q-learning in your Taxi problem but also to understand the learning dynamics and fine-tune the learning process for better results.\n",
